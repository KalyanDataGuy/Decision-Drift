### 🎬 The Story — *The Drift Begins*  

For **364 days**, we make choices that feel right.  
We trust dashboards, chase trends, and call it direction.  

Then on **Day 365 — we pause.**  
The numbers look the same,  
but the meaning has drifted.  

Small drifts become silent defaults —  
a process skipped, a metric ignored, a bias unchallenged —  
until the data loop tightens.  

📊 → 📉 → 🔁 *Loop of Choice and Change*  
*(a visual metaphor connecting daily decisions to drift)*

### 📘 The Insight — *Sensing the Drift*  

The pattern isn’t in the dataset;  
it’s in the rhythm of choices we repeat.  
That’s where the drift hides — in habits, not numbers.  

The model didn’t fail — we just stopped listening.  
Data doesn’t fade — it follows the drift of our decisions.  

Our task isn’t to measure everything —  
it’s to notice what’s quietly moving off course.  

So on **Day 365**, pause the dashboard.  
Let your decisions learn something new.
